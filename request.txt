- Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

In the future, one of my dream jobs would be working in cybersecurity. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Banja Luka and after doing some research I concluded that there is shortage of Cyber Security analysts and experts in our region and worldwide. Unfortunately, very little of those subjects are taught at my university and the best way to gain this knowledge for me is to take part in specializations like this one. Cybersecurity, pen-testing and cryptography have always been fascinating to me and this would be a great way for me to learn more about it. In addition, after completing my bachelor degree I am planning on continuing my education while also working in the industry. Therefore, I see this also as a great opportunity to find my possible research field in which I could work in the future. On top of all, I strongly believe that this course will give me good basis and will enable me to further expand my knowledge in this area. I hope that the knowledge gained through this first course will help me get started on my cybersecurity journey.


- How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

After the global pandemic, I got an opportunity to speak with one of the leading experts in the cybersecurity field from our region. After speaking with him and getting introduced with the field and companies that offer security solutions, we concluded on what skills and knowledge is needed for further cooperation and those match up very well with course's curriculum.
After reading books on Operating Systems (Tanenbaum, Bos), Computer Networks (Tanenbaum) and Computer Architecture (Hennessy) I believe that taking specialization in the form of this course is logical next step. Even though I would really like to pay for the course and support it I am unfortunately unable to do so. First of all Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with rather low standards and low salaries, which makes it rather hard to pay for the courses which are made with global standards in mind. Secondly, I am a student and besides living expenses, I also have to pay for my studies. While one of the solutions would be to work more besides university I think that would really endanger both my studies and health. Therefore I would be very grateful if you would approve my Financial Aid.


- Would you consider using a low-interest loan to pay for your courses?

For me taking a low-interest loan would mean taking more time from my studies to work to be able to repay it. Now I am really focused on my degree as I would also like to pursue Masters and PhD afterwards, which means I have to focus even more on having good results, especially if I want to go abroad for further studies. Furthermore, while I could maybe take more money from my parents, where only my father is employed, I think it would be unjust to my younger brother and sister that are both still in high school.



In the future, one of my dream jobs would be working with microservices and on distributed systems. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Banja Luka and after doing some research I concluded that there is shortage of cloud engineers experts in our region and worldwide. Unfortunately, very little of those subjects are taught at my university and the best way to gain this knowledge for me is to take part in specializations like this one. Web applications, DevOps, microservices and distributed programming have always been fascinating to me and this would be a great way for me to learn more about it. In addition, after completing my bachelor degree I am planning on continuing my education while also working in the industry. Therefore, I see this also as a great opportunity to find my possible research field in which I could work in the future.
